"negative","to call the other side of heaven "" appalling "" would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be ."
"negative","in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey ."
"negative","if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con ."
"negative","i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here ."
"negative","without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace ."
"negative","it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) ."
"negative","while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these ."
"negative","for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one ."
"negative","to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation ."
"negative","what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about ."
"negative","in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy ."
"negative","it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role ."
"negative","harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment ."
"negative",". . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects ."
"negative","it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation ."
"negative","a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction ."
"negative","not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions ."
"negative","a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left ."
"negative","once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard ."
"negative","the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate ."
"negative","what's next : "" my mother the car ? """
"negative","all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that , really , we've been here , done that ."
"negative","a sequel that's much too big for its britches ."
"negative","so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines ."
"negative","what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian ."
"negative","a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments ."
"negative","for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution ."
"negative","a coarse and stupid gross-out ."
"negative","a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes ."
"negative","doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence ."
"negative","there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route ."
"negative","it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions ."
"negative","the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious ."
"negative","but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative ."
"negative","rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment ."
"negative","tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar ."
"negative","paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat ."
"negative","harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all ."
"negative","this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against ."
"negative","a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity ."
"negative","the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second ."
"negative","basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars ."
"negative","too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization ."
"negative","an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow ."
"negative","it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible ."
"negative",""" the time machine "" is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor…it's just plain bored ."
"negative",". . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it ."
"negative","a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those "" can this marriage be saved ? "" columns from ladies home journal . . ."
"negative","the film's essentially over by the meet-cute ."
"negative","i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it ."
"negative","it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock ."
"negative","the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work ."
"negative","walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity ."
"negative","it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal ."
"negative","it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong ."
"negative","although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at ."
"negative","i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film ."
"negative","star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty ."
"negative","like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all ."
"negative","i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool ."
"negative",". . . although this idea is "" new "" the results are tired ."
"negative","i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long ."
"negative","an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc ."
"negative","the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish ."
"negative","its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks ."
"negative","for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam ."
"negative","don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk ."
"negative","not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through ."
"negative","the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation ."
"negative","plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread ."
"negative","a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug ."
"negative","this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous ."
"negative","vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them ."
"negative","[a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment ."
"negative","feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work ."
"negative","generic thriller junk . teens only ."
"negative","given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done ."
"negative","a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground"
"negative","a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going ."
"negative","stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time ."
"negative","pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal ."
"negative","with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here ."
"negative","it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense ."
"negative","movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction ."
"negative","[director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short ."
"negative","the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight ."
"negative","no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise ."
"negative","even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy ."
"negative","there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging ."
"negative","it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune ."
"negative","miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness ."
"negative","despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine ."
"negative","more maudlin than sharp ."
"negative","this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic ."
"negative","it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype ."
"negative","characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs ."
"negative","comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief ."
"negative","visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it ."
"negative","stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career ."
"negative","there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there ."
"negative","if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball ."
"negative","i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem ."
"negative","it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction ."
"negative","slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?"
"negative",". . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock ."
"negative","the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy ."
"negative","my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it ."
"negative","it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others ."
"negative","sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos ."
"negative","intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject ."
"negative","a non-mystery mystery ."
"negative","feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot ."
"negative","what an embarrassment ."
"negative","for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout ."
"negative","in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius ."
"negative","i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal ."
"negative","the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one ."
"negative","a workshop mentality prevails ."
"negative","it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull ."
"negative","pumpkin wants to have it both ways ."
"negative","director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback ."
"negative","[w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands ."
"negative","outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent ."
"negative","this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast ."
"negative","an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story ."
"negative","a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . ."
"negative","it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes ."
"negative","as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality ."
"negative","new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous ."
"negative","an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . ."
"negative","the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant ."
"negative","scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas ."
"negative","while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target ."
"negative","as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor ."
"negative","this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon ."
"negative","the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom ."
"negative",". . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . ."
"negative","burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast ."
"negative","an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce ."
"negative","has all the depth of a wading pool ."
"negative","this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing ."
"negative","the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks ."
"negative",". . . the movie is just a plain old monster ."
"negative","if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish ."
"negative","one long string of cliches ."
"negative","a noble failure ."
"negative","fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race ."
"negative","professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller ."
"negative","nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle ."
"negative","weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell ."
"negative","at once half-baked and overheated ."
"negative","there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it ."
"negative","i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough ."
"negative","[serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one ."
"negative","by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad ."
"negative","the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles – several of them ."
"negative","sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out ."
"negative","lástima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones ."
"negative","exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids ."
"negative","its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?"
"negative","woefully pretentious ."
"negative","the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand ."
"negative","a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year ."
"negative",". . . think of it as american pie on valium ."
"negative","dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled ."
"negative","puportedly "" based on true events , "" a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is "" based on a true story "" with a straight face ."
"negative",". . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this "" un-bear-able "" project !"
"negative",". . . irritating soul-searching garbage ."
"negative","it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel ."
"negative","with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap ."
"negative","some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/"
"negative","a relative letdown ."
"negative","better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery ."
"negative","no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars ."
"negative","manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious ."
"negative","warmed-over hash ."
