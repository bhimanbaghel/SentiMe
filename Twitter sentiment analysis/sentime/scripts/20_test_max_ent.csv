"negative","it's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure ."

"negative","it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy ."
"negative","louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense ."

"negative","patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary ."

"negative","so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it ."
"negative","one of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears ."
"negative","hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work ."
"negative",". . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish ."
"negative","it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull ."
"negative","when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems ."

"negative","'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived ."
"negative","ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film ."
"negative","this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks ."
"negative","'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '"
"negative","a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists ."
"negative","trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain ."
"negative","even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash ."
"negative","amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the "" other side of the story . """
"negative","rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue ."
"negative","it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit ."
"negative",". . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else ."
"negative","too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet ."
"negative","kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles ."
"negative","director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters ."
"negative","ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening ."
"negative","the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man ."
"negative","extremely bad ."
"negative","a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men ."
"negative","the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier ."
"negative","a little weak -- and it isn't that funny ."
"negative","while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire ."
"negative","the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy ."
"negative","despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book ."
"negative","in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that ."
"negative","cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility ."
"negative","worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades ."
"negative","the original wasn't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !"
"negative","one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison ."

"negative","your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make ."
"negative","includes too much obvious padding ."
"negative","there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme ."
"negative","i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid ."
"negative","don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle ."
"negative","the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers ."
"negative","shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . ."
"negative","spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy ."
"negative",". . . a movie that , quite simply , shouldn't have been made ."
"negative","conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences ."
"negative","looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito's way ."
"negative","the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material ."
"negative","suffers from all the excesses of the genre ."
"negative","the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them ."
"negative","the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year ."
"negative","downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message ."
"negative","while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires ."
"negative","they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering ."
"negative","it's harmless , diverting fluff . but it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre ."
"negative","it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly ."
"negative","comedy troupe broken lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot ."
"negative","pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick ."
"negative","a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness ."
"negative","it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt ."
"negative","'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '"
"negative","occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring ."
"negative","a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end ."
"negative","the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances ."
"negative","who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like "" they're back ! "" , "" they're out there ! "" and "" they're coming ! """
"negative","elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level ."
"negative","were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '"
